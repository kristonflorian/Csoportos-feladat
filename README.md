# Repont

<b>This Repo is for the 2024/2025 end of school year exam for the REpont group from SZIKSZI, and it is used to track changes we made to the project along the way</b><br>
The project itself is about providing users with an interface where they can track their progress in returning bottles, and getting achievements in the process, along with a database of machines, so they can check which ones are the closest to them
